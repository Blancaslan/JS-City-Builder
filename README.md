This is a city builder game and my first personal project, It is written in javascript and resembles the hit game City Skylines.

The entire GUI will be in terminal. I plan on giving it a proper GUI through either a web or desktop app but that is set aside for after these foundations have been set.

How To Run.
To run the app you have to:
Download the code,
open it up in an IDE with an install of node.js,
then run the main.js file.

I try my best to keep the code as modular and reusable as possible to save development time and performance.

FYI: It's still very work in progress so some commits being pushed might have weird code that isnt used anymore/half finished code.
